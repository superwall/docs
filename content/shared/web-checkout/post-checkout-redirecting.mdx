After a user completes a web purchase, Superwall needs to redirect them back to your app. You can configure this behavior in two ways:

## Post-Purchase Behavior Modes

You can configure how users are redirected after checkout in your [Application Settings](/web-checkout-configuring-stripe-keys-and-settings#post-purchase-behavior):

### Redeem Mode (Default)

Superwall manages the entire redemption experience:
- Users are automatically deep linked to your app with a redemption code
- Fallback to App Store/Play Store if the app isn't installed
- Redemption emails are sent automatically
- The SDK handles redemption via delegate methods (detailed below)

This is the recommended mode for most apps.

### Redirect Mode

Redirect users to your own custom URL with purchase information:
- **When to use**: You want to show a custom success page, perform additional actions before redemption, or have your own deep linking infrastructure
- **What you receive**: Purchase data is passed as query parameters to your URL

**Query Parameters Included**:
- `app_user_id` - The user's identifier from your app
- `email` - User's email address
- `stripe_subscription_id` - The Stripe subscription ID
- Any custom placement parameters you set

**Example**:
```
https://yourapp.com/success?
  app_user_id=user_123&
  email=user@example.com&
  stripe_subscription_id=sub_1234567890&
  campaign_id=summer_sale
```

You'll need to implement your own logic to handle the redirect and deep link users into your app.

## Setting Up Deep Links

Whether you're showing a checkout page in Safari or using the In-App Browser, the Superwall SDK relies on deep links to redirect back to your app.

#### Prerequisites
1. [Configuring Stripe Keys and Settings](/web-checkout-configuring-stripe-keys-and-settings)
2. [Deep Links](/in-app-paywall-previews)

<Warning>
  If you're not using Superwall to handle purchases, then you'll need to follow extra steps to redeem the web purchase in your app.
</Warning>

- [Using RevenueCat](/web-checkout-using-revenuecat)
- [Using a PurchaseController](/web-checkout-linking-membership-to-iOS-app#using-a-purchasecontroller)

## Handling Redemption (Redeem Mode)

When using Redeem mode (the default), handle the user experience when they're redirected back to your app using `SuperwallDelegate` methods:

### willRedeemLink

When your app opens via the deep link, we will call the delegate method `willRedeemLink()` before making a network call to redeem the code.
At this point, you might wish to display a loading indicator in your app so the user knows that the purchase is being redeemed.

```swift
func willRedeemLink() {
  ToastView.show(message: "Activating...", showActivityIndicator: true)
}
```

To present your own loading UI on top of the paywall, you can access the view controller of the paywall via `Superwall.shared.presentedViewController`. You can manually dismiss the paywall here, but note that the completion block of the original `register` call won't be triggered. The paywall will be dismissed automatically when the `didRedeemLink` method is called.

### didRedeemLink

After receiving a response from the network, we will call `didRedeemLink(result:)` with the result of redeeming the code. This is an enum that has the following cases:

- `success(code: String, redemptionInfo: RedemptionInfo)`: The redemption succeeded and `redemptionInfo` contains information about the redeemed code.
- `error(code: String, error: ErrorInfo)`: An error occurred while redeeming. You can check the error message via the `error` parameter.
- `expiredCode(code: String, expired: ExpiredCodeInfo)`: The code expired and `ExpiredCodeInfo` contains information about whether a redemption email has been resent and an optional obfuscated email address that the redemption email was sent to.
- `invalidCode(code: String)`: The code that was redeemed was invalid.
- `expiredSubscription(code: String, redemptionInfo: RedemptionInfo)`: The subscription that the code redeemed has expired.

On network failure, the SDK will retry up to 6 times before returning an `error` `RedemptionResult` in `didRedeemLink(result:)`.


Here, you should remove any loading UI you added in `willRedeemLink` and show a message to the user based on the result. If a paywall is presented, it will be dismissed automatically.

```swift
func didRedeemLink(result: RedemptionResult) {
  switch result {
    case .expiredCode(let code, let expiredInfo):
      ToastView.show(message: "Expired Link", systemImageName: "exclamationmark.square.fill")
      print("[!] code expired", code, expiredInfo)
      break
    case .error(let code, let error):
      ToastView.show(message: error.message, systemImageName: "exclamationmark.square.fill")
      print("[!] error", code, error)
      break
    case .expiredSubscription(let code, let redemptionInfo):
      ToastView.show(message: "Expired Subscription", systemImageName: "exclamationmark.square.fill")
      print("[!] expired subscription", code, redemptionInfo)
      break
    case .invalidCode(let code):
      ToastView.show(message: "Invalid Link", systemImageName: "exclamationmark.square.fill")
      print("[!] invalid code", code)
      break
    case .success(_, let redemptionInfo):
      if let email = redemptionInfo.purchaserInfo.email {
        Superwall.shared.setUserAttributes(["email": email])
        ToastView.show(message: email, systemImageName: "person.circle.fill")
      } 
      else {
        ToastView.show(message: "Welcome!", systemImageName: "person.circle.fill")
      }
      break
  }
}
```
