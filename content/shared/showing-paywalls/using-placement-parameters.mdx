title: "Using Placement Parameters"
description: "Placement parameters allow you to send additional data to the Superwall platform when registering placements."
---

You can send parameters along with any placement you create. For example, if you had a caffeine logging app — perhaps you'd have a placement for logging caffeine:

```swift
// In iOS...
Superwall.shared.register(placement: "caffeineLogged") {
    store.log(amountToLog)
}
```

Now, imagine you could log caffeine from several different touch points in your app. You may wish to know _where_ the user tried to log caffeine from, and you could tie a parameter to the `caffeineLogged` placement to do this:

<CodeGroup>

```swift iOS
Superwall.shared.register(placement: "caffeineLogged", params: ["via":"logging_page"]) {
  store.log(amountToLog)
}
```

```kotlin Android
val params: Map<String, Any> = mapOf(
    "via" to "logging_page"
)
Superwall.instance.register("caffeineLogged", params = params)  {
    store.log(amountToLog)
}
```

```dart Flutter
final params = <String, dynamic>{"via": "logging_page"};
Superwall.shared.registerPlacement(
  "placement",
  params: params,
  feature: () {
    logToStore(100);
  }
);
```

```typescript React Native
Superwall.shared.register({
  placement: 'caffeineLogged',
  params: new Map([["via", "logging_page"]]),
  feature: ()=>{
    console.log("show coffee")
  }
});
```

</CodeGroup>

The `via` parameter could now be used all throughout Superwall. You could create a new [audience](/campaigns-audience) which has filters for each place users logged caffeine from, and unique paywalls for each of them.

Parameter placements can be used in four primary ways:

1. **Audience Filtering:** As mentioned above, you can filter against parameters when creating audiences. Following our example, you'd create a **placement parameter** named **via** and then choose how to filter off of the parameter's value:

   <Frame>![](/images/placementParamVia.png)</Frame>

2. **Templating in Text:** Parameters are available in our [paywall editor](/paywall-editor-overview), so you can easily use them in text components too:

```
Hey {{user.firstName}}! FitnessAI offers tons of {{user.fitnessGoal}} workouts to help you reach your goals :)
```

3. **Interfacing with Analytics:** Another common scenario is cohorting with your own analytics. See this [doc](/cohorting-in-3rd-party-tools) for more.

4. **Reference them on Paywalls:** Display dynamic images by constructing URLs based on placement parameters, change copy on a paywall to emphasize a feature, and more. For more, check out the docs over [creating custom variables](/paywall-editor-variables#custom-variables).
