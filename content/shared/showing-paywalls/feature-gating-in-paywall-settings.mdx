When a paywall is open in the editor, you'll see a setting for "Feature Gating" in the leading sidebar:

<Frame>![](/images/feature-gate-editor-setting.png)</Frame>

Feature gating allows your team to retroactively decide if this paywall is _Gated_ or _Non Gated_

| Type                    | Behavior                                                                 | Example                                                                                                                          |

| **Non Gated** (default) | Show Paywall → Execute Feature                                           | When "Sign Up" button is pressed, show a paywall, then continue onboarding once the paywall is dismissed.                        |
| **Gated**               | Show Paywall → Is user paying?If Yes → Execute FeatureIf No → Do Nothing | When "Start Workout" button is pressed, show a paywall, then continue once the paywall is dismissed only if the user subscribes. |

Remember, the feature is always executed if:

1. No campaign is configured for the placement.
2. The user is already paying or subscribed.
