## Superwall Docs MCP
The Superwall Docs MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/use-remote-mcp-server)) is a tool that allows your favorite AI tools to search the Superwall Docs and get context from the docs.

### Cursor

You can install the MCP server in Cursor by clicking this button:
[![Install MCP Server](/images/cursor-mcp-install-light.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=superwall-docs-mcp&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5zdXBlcndhbGwuY29tL21jcCJ9)

or by adding the following to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superwall-docs": {
      "url": "https://mcp.superwall.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

You can install the MCP server in Claude Code by running the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse superwall-docs https://mcp.superwall.com/sse
```

## Superwall Docs GPT

You can use the [Superwall Docs GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6888175f1684819180302d66f4e61971-superwall-docs-gpt) right in the ChatGPT app, and use it to ask any Superwall question. 

It has the full knowledge of the Superwall Docs, and can be used with all the ChatGPT features you love like using the context of your files straight from your IDE.


## Ask AI

The built-in [Ask AI tool](https://superwall.com/docs/ai) in the Superwall Docs is a great place to start if you have a question or issue.


## Docs Links

On each page of the Superwall Docs (including this one!), you can find in the top right corner:

- **Copy page**: to copy the page in Markdown format.

Also in the dropdown menu, you can access these options:

- **View as markdown**: to view the page in Markdown format
- **Open in ChatGPT**, **Open in Claude**: to open the page in the respective AI tool and add the page as context for your conversation


## LLMs.txt
The Superwall Docs website has `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files, in total and for each SDK, that you can use to add context to your LLMs.

`llms.txt` is a summary of the docs with links to each page.

`llms-full.txt` is the full text of all of the docs.
