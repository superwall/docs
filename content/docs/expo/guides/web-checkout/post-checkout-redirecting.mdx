After a user completes a web purchase, Superwall needs to redirect them back to your app. You can configure this behavior in two ways:

## Post-Purchase Behavior Modes

You can configure how users are redirected after checkout in your [Application Settings](/web-checkout-configuring-stripe-keys-and-settings#post-purchase-behavior):

### Redeem Mode (Default)

Superwall manages the entire redemption experience:
- Users are automatically deep linked to your app with a redemption code
- Fallback to App Store/Play Store if the app isn't installed
- Redemption emails are sent automatically
- The SDK handles redemption via delegate methods (detailed below)

This is the recommended mode for most apps.

### Redirect Mode

Redirect users to your own custom URL with purchase information:
- **When to use**: You want to show a custom success page, perform additional actions before redemption, or have your own deep linking infrastructure
- **What you receive**: Purchase data is passed as query parameters to your URL

**Query Parameters Included**:
- `app_user_id` - The user's identifier from your app
- `email` - User's email address
- `stripe_subscription_id` - The Stripe subscription ID
- Any custom placement parameters you set

**Example**:
```
https://yourapp.com/success?
  app_user_id=user_123&
  email=user@example.com&
  stripe_subscription_id=sub_1234567890&
  campaign_id=summer_sale
```

You'll need to implement your own logic to handle the redirect and deep link users into your app.

## Setting Up Deep Links

Whether you're showing a checkout page in a browser or using the In-App Browser, the Superwall SDK relies on deep links to redirect back to your app.

#### Prerequisites
1. [Configuring Stripe Keys and Settings](/web-checkout-configuring-stripe-keys-and-settings)
2. [Deep Links](/in-app-paywall-previews)

<Warning>
  If you're not using Superwall to handle purchases, then you'll need to follow extra steps to redeem the web purchase in your app.
</Warning>

- [Using RevenueCat](/web-checkout-using-revenuecat)
- [Using a PurchaseController](/web-checkout-linking-membership-to-iOS-app#using-a-purchasecontroller)

## Handling Redemption (Redeem Mode)

When using Redeem mode (the default), handle the user experience when they're redirected back to your app using `SuperwallDelegate` methods:

### willRedeemLink

When your app opens via the deep link, we will call the delegate method `willRedeemLink()` before making a network call to redeem the code.
At this point, you might wish to display a loading indicator in your app so the user knows that the purchase is being redeemed.

```typescript
import { SuperwallDelegate } from 'expo-superwall/compat';
import { Toast } from 'react-native-toast-message'; // or your preferred toast library

export class SWDelegate extends SuperwallDelegate {
  willRedeemLink(): void {
    // Show a loading indicator to the user
    Toast.show({
      type: 'info',
      text1: 'Activating your purchase...',
    });
  }
}
```

You can manually dismiss the paywall at this point if needed, but note that the paywall will be dismissed automatically when the `didRedeemLink` method is called.

### didRedeemLink

After receiving a response from the network, we will call `didRedeemLink(result)` with the result of redeeming the code. This result can be one of the following:

- `RedemptionResult` with `type: 'success'`: The redemption succeeded and contains information about the redeemed code.
- `RedemptionResult` with `type: 'error'`: An error occurred while redeeming. You can check the error message via the error parameter.
- `RedemptionResult` with `type: 'expiredCode'`: The code expired and contains information about whether a redemption email has been resent and an optional obfuscated email address.
- `RedemptionResult` with `type: 'invalidCode'`: The code that was redeemed was invalid.
- `RedemptionResult` with `type: 'expiredSubscription'`: The subscription that the code redeemed has expired.

On network failure, the SDK will retry up to 6 times before returning an `error` `RedemptionResult` in `didRedeemLink(result)`.

Here, you should remove any loading UI you added in `willRedeemLink` and show a message to the user based on the result. If a paywall is presented, it will be dismissed automatically.

```typescript
import { SuperwallDelegate, RedemptionResult } from 'expo-superwall/compat';
import Superwall from 'expo-superwall/compat';
import { Toast } from 'react-native-toast-message'; // or your preferred toast library

export class SWDelegate extends SuperwallDelegate {
  didRedeemLink(result: RedemptionResult): void {
    switch (result.type) {
      case 'expiredCode':
        Toast.show({
          type: 'error',
          text1: 'Expired Link',
        });
        console.log('[!] code expired', result.code, result.expiredInfo);
        break;
      
      case 'error':
        Toast.show({
          type: 'error',
          text1: result.error.message,
        });
        console.log('[!] error', result.code, result.error);
        break;
      
      case 'expiredSubscription':
        Toast.show({
          type: 'error',
          text1: 'Expired Subscription',
        });
        console.log('[!] expired subscription', result.code, result.redemptionInfo);
        break;
      
      case 'invalidCode':
        Toast.show({
          type: 'error',
          text1: 'Invalid Link',
        });
        console.log('[!] invalid code', result.code);
        break;
      
      case 'success':
        const email = result.redemptionInfo?.purchaserInfo?.email;
        if (email) {
          Superwall.shared.setUserAttributes({ email });
          Toast.show({
            type: 'success',
            text1: `Welcome, ${email}!`,
          });
        } else {
          Toast.show({
            type: 'success',
            text1: 'Welcome!',
          });
        }
        break;
    }
  }
}
```
