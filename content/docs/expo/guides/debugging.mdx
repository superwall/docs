## Cannot find native module 'SuperwallExpo'

This error occurs when the native Superwall module isn't properly linked in your app. There are several common causes.

### Cause 1: Using Expo Go

**Expo Go does not support custom native modules.** Superwall requires native code that isn't included in Expo Go.

**Solution:** Use an [Expo Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) instead.

```bash
# For iOS
npx expo run:ios

# For Android
npx expo run:android
```

<Note>
You can tell you're running Expo Go if the app icon is the Expo logo. Your development build will show your own app icon.
</Note>

### Cause 2: Outdated Native Folders

If you added `expo-superwall` to an existing project, your `ios` and `android` folders may be outdated and missing the native module configuration.

**Solution:** Regenerate your native folders:

```bash
# Clean and regenerate native folders
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

This will delete your existing `ios` and `android` folders and regenerate them with the correct native module configuration.

<Warning>
If you've made manual changes to your native folders, back them up first. The `--clean` flag will remove all custom native code.
</Warning>

### Cause 3: EAS Build Not Updated

If you're using EAS Build, you need to create a new development build after adding `expo-superwall`.

**Solution:** Build a new development client:

```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
# or
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### Cause 4: Stale Caches

Cached build artifacts can cause issues after updating dependencies.

**Solution:** Clear all caches and rebuild:

```bash
# Clear watchman (if installed)
watchman watch-del-all

# Clear Expo cache
npx expo start --clear

# Remove and reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
npm install  # or yarn/pnpm/bun

# For iOS: reinstall pods
cd ios && pod install --repo-update && cd ..

# Rebuild
npx expo run:ios
```

### Cause 5: Version Incompatibility

Your Expo SDK version may not be compatible with `expo-superwall`.

**Solution:** Run the Expo doctor to check for issues:

```bash
npx expo-doctor
npx expo install --check
```

<Warning>
Superwall requires **Expo SDK 53 or higher**. If you're on an older version, upgrade your Expo SDK first.
</Warning>

### Still Having Issues?

If none of the above solutions work:

1. **Completely clean rebuild:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules ios android .expo
   npm install
   npx expo prebuild --clean
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

2. **Verify the package is installed:**
   ```bash
   npm ls expo-superwall
   ```

3. **Check for conflicting packages** that might interfere with native module resolution
