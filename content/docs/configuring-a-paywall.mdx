The Paywall Editor consists of 3 sections:

1. [The settings sidebar](/paywall-settings-sidebar) \- General paywall settings, designs and products to show on the paywall.
2. [The device preview](/interactive-paywall-preview) \- An interactive preview of your paywall in a device of your choosing.
3. [The variable editor](interactive-paywall-preview#adding-variables) \- Fully customise items, such as text or images, on your paywall.
