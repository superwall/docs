title: "getPaywall()"
description: "A function that retrieves a PaywallViewController for custom presentation."
---

<Warning>
You're responsible for ensuring the returned `PaywallViewController` is no longer presented or embedded in a view after the user has moved past the paywall. The app may crash if you or the SDK attempts to present the same `PaywallViewController` instance again from elsewhere. Be especially careful when mixing `register()` and `getPaywall()`, which is not recommended.
</Warning>

<Note>
The remotely configured presentation style is ignored when using this method. You must handle presentation styling programmatically.
</Note>

## Purpose
Retrieves a PaywallViewController that you can present however you want, bypassing Superwall's automatic presentation logic.

## Signature
```swift
// Async/await version
@MainActor
public func getPaywall(
  forPlacement placement: String,
  params: [String: Any]? = nil,
  paywallOverrides: PaywallOverrides? = nil,
  delegate: PaywallViewControllerDelegate
) async throws -> PaywallViewController

// Completion handler version
public func getPaywall(
  forPlacement placement: String,
  params: [String: Any]? = nil,
  paywallOverrides: PaywallOverrides? = nil,
  delegate: PaywallViewControllerDelegate,
  completion: @escaping (PaywallViewController?, PaywallSkippedReason?, Error?) -> Void
)
```

## Parameters
<ParamTable>
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `placement` | `String` | The name of the placement as defined on the Superwall dashboard. |
| `params` | `[String: Any]?` | Optional parameters to pass with your placement for audience filters. Keys beginning with `$` are reserved and will be dropped. Defaults to `nil`. |
| `paywallOverrides` | `PaywallOverrides?` | Optional overrides for products and presentation style. Defaults to `nil`. |
| `delegate` | `PaywallViewControllerDelegate` | A delegate to handle user interactions with the retrieved PaywallViewController. |
| `completion` | `@escaping (PaywallViewController?, PaywallSkippedReason?, Error?) -> Void` | Completion block for the callback version. |
</ParamTable>

## Returns / State
Returns a `PaywallViewController` that you can present. If presentation should be skipped, throws a `PaywallSkippedReason` error.

## Usage

Using async/await:
```swift
Task {
  do {
    let paywallViewController = try await Superwall.shared.getPaywall(
      forPlacement: "premium_feature",
      params: ["source": "settings"],
      delegate: self
    )
    
    present(paywallViewController, animated: true)
  } catch let reason as PaywallSkippedReason {
    print("Paywall skipped: \(reason)")
  } catch {
    print("Error getting paywall: \(error)")
  }
}
```

Using completion handler:
```swift
Superwall.shared.getPaywall(
  forPlacement: "premium_feature",
  delegate: self
) { paywall, skippedReason, error in
  if let paywall = paywall {
    present(paywall, animated: true)
  } else if let reason = skippedReason {
    print("Paywall skipped: \(reason)")
  } else if let error = error {
    print("Error: \(error)")
  }
}
```
