description: "Gets properties stored about the device that are used in audience filters."
---

<Info>
This method returns all device attributes that can be used in audience filters in the Superwall dashboard.
</Info>

## Purpose
Retrieves a dictionary of device properties that are used when evaluating audience filters. This is useful for debugging audience filter behavior or understanding what device attributes are available.

## Signature
```swift
public func getDeviceAttributes() async -> [String: Any]
```

## Parameters
No parameters.

## Returns / State
Returns a dictionary mapping attribute names to their values. Common attributes include:
- `isApplePayAvailable` - Whether Apple Pay is available and the user has added a card (available in version 4.9.0+)
- `swiftVersion` - The Swift version (available in version 4.7.0+)
- `compilerVersion` - The compiler version (available in version 4.7.0+)
- `localeIdentifier` - The device locale
- `osVersion` - The iOS version
- `model` - The device model
- And many more device-specific attributes

## Usage

Get device attributes:
```swift
let deviceAttributes = await Superwall.shared.getDeviceAttributes()

// Check specific attributes
if let isApplePayAvailable = deviceAttributes["isApplePayAvailable"] as? Bool {
  print("Apple Pay available: \(isApplePayAvailable)")
}

// Print all attributes for debugging
print("Device attributes: \(deviceAttributes)")
```

Use in audience filter debugging:
```swift
Task {
  let attributes = await Superwall.shared.getDeviceAttributes()
  
  // Check if user matches an audience filter condition
  if let swiftVersion = attributes["swiftVersion"] as? String {
    print("Swift version: \(swiftVersion)")
  }
}
```
