To see the latest release, [check out the repository](https://github.com/superwall/Superwall-iOS).

You can install via [Swift Package Manager](#install-via-swift-package-manager) or [CocoaPods](#install-via-cocoapods).

## Install via Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the Swift compiler.

In **Xcode**, select **File ▸ Add Packages...**:

**Then, paste the GitHub repository URL:**

```

```

in the search bar. With the **Superwall-iOS** source selected, set the **Dependency Rule** to **Up to Next Major Version** with the lower bound set to **4.0.0**. Make sure your project name is selected in **Add to Project**. Then click **Add Package**:

## Install via CocoaPods

First, add the following to your Podfile:

`pod 'SuperwallKit', '< 5.0.0'
`

Next, run `pod repo update` to update your local spec repo. [Why?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43701352/what-exactly-does-pod-repo-update-do).

Finally, run `pod install` from your terminal. Note that in your target's **Build Settings -> User Script Sandboxing**, this value should be set to **No**.

### Updating to a New Release

To update to a new beta release, you'll need to update the version specified in the Podfile and then run `pod install` again.

### Import SuperwallKit

You should now be able to `import SuperwallKit`:


<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift
import SuperwallKit
```

```swift Objective-C
@import SuperwallKit;
```
</CodeGroup>
