## Best Practices

1. **Dedicated Channels**: Create specific channels for different event types
2. **Filter Appropriately**: Use "Revenue Only" for finance, "All Events" for customer success
3. **Include Context**: User IDs help connect events to support tickets
4. **Monitor Patterns**: Watch for unusual cancellation or refund spikes
5. **Sandbox Separation**: Consider separate webhooks for production vs testing

## Troubleshooting

### Messages Not Appearing

1. **Check Webhook URL**: Ensure URL is valid and not revoked
2. **Check Channel**: Verify bot has access to target channel
3. **Check Filters**: Confirm event type and sandbox settings
4. **Check Slack Limits**: Webhook rate limits (1 per second)

### Incorrect Information

1. **Check Timezone**: Timestamps are in UTC
2. **Check Currency**: Amounts in USD, original currency shown
3. **Check User ID**: Falls back to transaction ID if not available

### Test the Integration

Send a test event to verify setup:
1. Configure the integration
2. A test message is automatically sent
3. Check your Slack channel
4. Look for "🧪 Test event" message

## Rate Limits

Slack incoming webhooks have a rate limit of 1 message per second. The integration sends events individually as they occur, typically well within this limit.

## Security Considerations

- **Webhook URLs are sensitive**: Treat like passwords
- **Rotate if compromised**: Generate new webhook URL if leaked
- **Channel permissions**: Ensure appropriate team members have access
- **PII considerations**: User IDs may be visible to channel members

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Channels
Set up multiple integrations for different channels:
- Revenue events → #revenue-alerts
- Cancellations → #customer-success
- All events → #subscription-monitoring

### Custom Filtering
While the integration offers two preset filters, you can:
- Use Slack workflows for additional filtering
- Set up multiple integrations with different settings
- Use Slack's notification preferences per channel
