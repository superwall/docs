To localize your paywall, **click** on the **Localization** button from the **sidebar**:

<Frame>![](/images/localizeSidebar.webp)</Frame>

There are two ways to localize your paywall:

<Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-localize-modes.webp)</Frame>

1. **Simple**: Here, you can use AI to localize your paywall into any language. You can manually refine each value at any point. Quick and accurate.
2. **Advanced**: User external .strings files to localize your paywall. This is ideal when you are using external localization services.

<Note>You can switch between the two methods at any time.</Note>

### Simple localization

Once enabled, a new side panel will present to help you localize you paywall:

<Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-simple-ui-localize.webp)</Frame>

You can control localization with the options at the top:

<Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-top-options.webp)</Frame>

Here's what each options does, left-to-right:

| Name           | Description                                                                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Localization   | Opens a menu with options to access AI localize settings, switch to advanced localizations, or clear all localizations. |
| Missing Only      | Filters the list to show only keys that have no localized value.                                      |
| Import/Export  | Allows importing or exporting localization data as a `.csv` file.                                     |
| AI Localize    | Starts the AI-powered localization process for selected keys.                                         |
| Add Language   | Lets you specify a new language to add for localization.                                              |

To start the AI localization process, **click** on the **Add Language** button. Then, choose **AI Localize**. Superwall will being to localize each value, while respecting the AI Localize settings in place: 

<Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-localize-in-progress.webp)</Frame>

Once finished, you'll see all localized values:

<Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-localize-done.webp)</Frame>

<Tip>You can click on any value to edit it manually.</Tip>

#### AI localization settings

You can customize how AI localization behaves by changing the settings in the **AI Localize Settings** menu:

<Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-localize-settings.webp)</Frame>

The **Formality Style** lets you toggle between formal and informal language. Use the **Localization Style Guide** to provide specific instructions to your brand's voice accurately.

#### Managing languages 

To remove or reset a language, **click** on the **three dotts** button next to the language:

<Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-localize-remove-reset.webp)</Frame>

To switch back and forth between languages, simply **click** the language at the top:

<Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-localize-change.webp)</Frame>

### Advanced localization

After opening the localization panel referenced above, **click** on the **Add Language** button. Choose the language identifier of the locale you're localizing for, and **click** on **Add**:

<Frame>![](/images/localizeAddLanguage.webp)</Frame>

If there are any existing text components on your paywall, all of them with currently _unlocalized_ strings will populate in the sidebar (in this example, we're localizing our text for Spanish speakers):

<Frame>![](/images/localizeMissingStrings.webp)</Frame>

Click on the **Localize** button on any of them to enter in localized values. When you're done, click **Save**:

<Frame>![](/images/localizeModalExample.webp)</Frame>

From there, go through and localize all of the values. Keep an eye on the progress bar at the top to see how far along you are. Remember to **click** on the **Publish** button at the top right of the editor to commit any localization edits.

<Tip>
  When you are localizing strings, the editor will reflect the locale you're editing against so you
  can see a live preview of how the text will appear.
</Tip>

#### Associating localized strings to new or existing text components

When you add new text components, or need to associate a different localization to an existing one — **click** the **Localize** button when the text component is selected. You can either use an existing localized string, or add a new one by clicking the plus button:

<Frame>![](/images/localizeViaTextStep1.webp)</Frame>

When a text component has a localized string attached to it, you'll see the localized string's key in place of the localize button:

<Frame>![](/images/localizeViaTextStep3.webp)</Frame>

<Tip>
  You can use variables with localized strings, too. Simply use liquid syntax within your localized
  string values to access any variable. Currently, variables themselves are not able to be
  localized. Learn more about using variables [here](/paywall-editor-variables).
</Tip>


#### Using .strings files

You can download and import .strings files to speed up your translations. This is ideal when you are using external localization services or have a large number of strings to localize.

#### Exporting .strings files

Select **Localization** from the left sidebar, **click** on the **Import** button. Choose "Download template" and the .strings file will be downloaded with all of your currently localized strings:

<Frame>![](/images/overviewLocalizationImportExport.webp)</Frame>

#### Importing .strings files

Select **Localization** from the left sidebar, **click** on the **Import** button.  Choose "Import Strings File" and select your local .strings file to upload. Then, all of the updated values will be reflected in the editor.

### Localizing period lengths

Superwall will automatically localize period lengths for products. Simply use any of the period-based variables in your text:

<Frame>![](/images/auto-localize-period.webp)</Frame>

For example:

```liquid
Analyze the math of caffeine this {{ products.primary.period | locale: "en" }}

// English, French, and any or any other localized regions you support...
Analyze the math of caffeine this year
Analysez les chiffres de la caféine ce année
```

You can override and remove auto-localization on specific items by setting a `locale` filter:

```liquid
Analyze the math of caffeine this {{ products.primary.period | locale: “en” }}

// Now, it'll show in English in every language 
Analysez les chiffres de la caféine ce year
```

### Testing localized strings 

You can preview how localized strings will appear on device. To set this up:

1. Make sure you've got [in-app previews](/in-app-paywall-previews) configured.
2. Open the paywall editor and click "Preview":
<Frame>![](/images/localizePreview.webp)</Frame>
3. When it opens, tap the menu located at the top left and choose "Localization":
<Frame>![](/images/localizeMenuButton.webp)</Frame>
4. Then, select the language to display and the preview will reload with it:
<Frame>![](/images/localizeResult.webp)</Frame>
