### Adding a carousel component

The carousel component was built to make progressing slide designs easy. It's similar to a [slides component](/paywall-editor-slides-component), except it automatically progresses through its contents instead of being primarily gesture driven. To use the carousel component:

1. In the left sidebar, click **+** to add a new element.
2. Choose **Carousel** under the "Layout" header.

The carousel component requires an explicit `width` set. Generally, setting this to 100% of the viewport's width works well. This is also the default size set:

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-carousel-width.webp)</Frame>

By default:

- The carousel `Scroll` property is set to `Paging`. Required.
- It's `Wrap` property is set to `Don't Wrap`. Required.
- The `Snap Position` property is set to `Center`. Editable.
- `Auto Paging` is set to `Enabled`. Editable.
- Finally, `Paging Delay` is intentionally set low to help with designing its content. Set it to a higher value to see the carousel in action.

### Adding contents to carousels

The carousel component has a few demonstration items added to it by default. You can remove these and add your own content:

### Tracking or updating the displayed element in a carousel

When a carousel element is added, Superwall automatically creates an element variable for it (accessed through the **[Variables](/paywall-editor-variables)** tab in the left sidebar, or the variables button in the **[floating toolbar](/paywall-editor-floating-toolbar)**). Its name will match whatever is in the element hierarchy in the left sidebar:

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-carousel-vars.webp)</Frame>

You can use this to:

- Select a product based off of the index of the carousel.
- Have a button progress to the next slide.
- Change text using [dynamic values](/paywall-editor-dynamic-values) based on the index.
- etc.

<Note>
  The variable's name is derived by the node's unique identifier. You don't need to set or generally
  be aware of this value.
</Note>

For example, here the button progresses to the next slide by incrementing the slides `Child Page Index` variable:

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-carousel-update.webp)</Frame>

As another example, we could change the text to represent the different product periods we've set up for our fictional products of weekly, monthly and annual. By using a dynamic value, we can simply check which carousel index is showing and change the text accordingly:
