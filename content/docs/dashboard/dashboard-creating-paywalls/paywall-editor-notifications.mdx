To configure a notification which displays before a free trials ends, click the **Notifications** button from the **sidebar**

You can add a local notification that fires after a number of days when a free trial has been purchased. After the user starts a free trial, it will ask them to enable notifications if they haven't already done so.

<Note>In sandbox mode, the free trial reminder will fire after x minutes, instead of x days.</Note>

### Configuration

To turn on a trial reminder notification, click **+ Add Notification**. From there, there are four fields to configure:

1. **Title**: Shows at the top of the notification.
2. **Subtitle**: Displays directly below the title in a smaller font. Not required.
3. **Body**: Shows in the primary body of the notification.
4. **Delay**: Any delay you'd like to apply after the free trial begins.

Here's where those values show up on a notification:

Also, keep in mind that these will be scheduled as a local notification as soon as they are configured.
