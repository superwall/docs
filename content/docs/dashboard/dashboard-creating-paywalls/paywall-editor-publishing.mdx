To set your paywall live, click the **Publish** button in the top-right side of the editor:

<Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-publish.png)</Frame>

Setting your paywall live doesn't necessarily mean that users will see it. You'll first need to associate a paywall with a [campaign](/campaign). From there, either a user is matched to an audience filter or a [placement](/feature-gating) is evaluated which results in a paywall being presented.

<Note>
  Changes you make are saved locally, even if you haven't published the paywall. Refreshing won't
  erase progress if you close the tab and come back later, unless you sign out.
