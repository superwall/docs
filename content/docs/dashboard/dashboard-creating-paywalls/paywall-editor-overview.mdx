There are two primary ways to create a paywall:

1. Using our editor from scratch.
2. Or, start with a [template](https://superwall.com/applications/:app/templates) and edit it to fit your needs.

### Using the Editor

On the Superwall dashboard under **Paywalls**, click **\+ New Paywall** and select **From Scratch**:

The Paywall Editor consists of 3 sections:

1. **Sidebar \-** General paywall settings, designs and products to show on the paywall. You can toggle through its sections using keyboard shortcuts such as `command/control 1/2/3`, etc.
2. **[Device Preview](/paywall-editor-previewing) \-** An interactive preview of your paywall on a mock device.
3. **Component Editor \-** Fully customize components, use variables and more on your paywall.

### Starting with a Template

On the Superwall dashboard under **Paywalls**, click **\+ New Paywall** and select **Use Template**:

This will redirect you to the templates page where you can browse different types of paywall templates. Clicking on one will allow you to preview it:

Click **Use Template**, and it will open in our editor ready to customize:

### Request a Design

If you have an existing design in Figma, Sketch or something similar, you can ask Superwall to create it for you in our editor. Please allow about five business days from the date of your request (give or take). Once it's finished, it'll be uploaded to your Superwall account.

To request one, on the Superwall dashboard under **Paywalls**, click **\+ New Paywall** and select **Request a Template**:

### Legacy Editor

If you're still using our legacy editor, you can still access those docs [here](/configuring-a-paywall). If you're not sure which editor you're using, any legacy editor will have a `v3` or lower in the URL:
