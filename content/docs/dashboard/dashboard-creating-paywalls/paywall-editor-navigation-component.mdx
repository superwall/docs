### Adding a navigation component
The navigation component was built to make paging, or navigating through paywall content, easy. To use the navigation component:

1. In the left sidebar, click **+** to add a new element.
2. Choose **Navigation** under the "Base Elements" header.

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-nav-element.png)</Frame>

You'll see the navigation component in the element hierarchy. **In most cases, you'll want a navigation's width to be 100% of the viewport**:

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-nav-width.png)</Frame>

From there, add in content to create pages using [stacks](/paywall-editor-stacks):

Similar to the parent navigation element, it helps to have the width of your stacks be 100% of the parent.

### Changing pages 
When a navigation element is added, Superwall automatically creates an element variable for it (accessed through the **[Variables](/paywall-editor-variables)** tab in the left sidebar, or the variables button in the **[floating toolbar](/paywall-editor-floating-toolbar)**). Its name will match whatever is in the element hierarchy in the left sidebar:

Each top-level child within the navigation component represents a _current index_ value, starting from 0. Changing this value will change which page is displayed. In this example, we add a [tap behavior](/paywall-editor-styling-elements#tap-behaviors) to the button, which increments the element variable's `current index` value:

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-nav-toggle-page.gif)</Frame>

<Note>
The variable's name is derived by the node's unique identifier. You don't need to set or generally be aware of this value.
</Note>

### Editing transitions

A navigation component has four different transitions to use. Edit them by **clicking** on the navigation component from the left sidebar, and then selecting a value in the trailing sidebar:

Available transitions are:

1. **No Transition:** No animation will occur during page changes.
2. **Push:** Each page is pushed on or off of the next page, similar to navigation stacks in iOS.
3. **Fade:** Each page change results in an opacity fade in or out.
4. **Slide:** Similar to push, but the animation results in a smooth transition between pages, much like scrolling through a carousel would look.
