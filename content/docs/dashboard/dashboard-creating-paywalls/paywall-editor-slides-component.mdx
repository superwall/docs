### Adding a slides component
The slide component was built to make interactive slide designs easy. It's similar to a [carousel](/paywall-editor-carousel-component), except its meant to be driven by user gestures instead of automatically progressing through its contents. To use the slides component:

1. In the left sidebar, click **+** to add a new element.
2. Choose **Slides** under the "Layout" header.

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-slides-component.webp)</Frame>

The slides component requires an explicit `width` set. Generally, setting this to 100% of the viewport's width works well. This is also the default size set:

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-slides-width.webp)</Frame>

By default:

- The slides component is set to `Horizontal` scrolling.
- Scrolling indicators are created for you. Read below to see how you can customize these.
- A default height is assigned.
- The slides respond to gestures.

### Adding contents to slides

The slides component has a few demonstration items added to it by default. You can remove these and add your own content:

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-slides-items.webp)</Frame>

Here, the container stack determines the height. You can customize this as needed.

### Tracking or updating the displayed element in slides 

When a slides element is added, Superwall automatically creates an element variable for it (accessed through the **[Variables](/paywall-editor-variables)** tab in the left sidebar, or the variables button in the **[floating toolbar](/paywall-editor-floating-toolbar)**). Its name will match whatever is in the element hierarchy in the left sidebar:

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-slides-var.webp)</Frame>

You can use its `Child Page Index` variable to change which slide is showing. You can use this to manually set which slide is showing. Here, the button progresses to the next slide by incrementing the slides `Child Page Index` variable:

<Frame>![](/images/paywall-editor-carousel-vars.webp)</Frame>

<Note>
The variable's name is derived by the node's unique identifier. You don't need to set or generally be aware of this value.
</Note>

You can also reference this variable when using a [dynamic value](/paywall-editor-dynamic-values) to do things such as:

- Select a product based off of the index of the slide.
- Show custom paging indicators.
- Change text using [dynamic values](/paywall-editor-dynamic-values) based on the index.
- etc.
