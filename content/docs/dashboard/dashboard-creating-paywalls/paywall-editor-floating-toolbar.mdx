Use it to better preview your paywall designs, and see what it'll look like at different sizes or orientations. Here's what the options do, from left-to-right:

### Device

Use the device toggle to switch between:

- **iPhone SE:** A generalized smaller iPhone device preview.
- **iPhone:** A generalized iPhone device preview.
- **iPhone XL:** A iPhone device preview reflecting the Max and Plus sized device families.
- **iPad:** A generalized iPad device preview.
- **Desktop:** A generalized desktop-sized preview.

### Refresh

You can manually refresh the paywall device preview with the circle arrow button. You won't lose any progress when clicking this, as your changes are always saved locally.

### Variables

Use the variable window to quickly reference or edit variables used across your paywall. You can toggle by variables in use, or all of them.
