### Adding an autoscroll component
The autoscroll component was built to make creating marquee-like content easy. To use the autoscroll component:

1. In the left sidebar, click **+** to add a new element.
2. Choose **Autoscroll** under the "Layout" header.

The autoscroll component requires an explicit `width` set. Generally, setting this to 100% of the viewport's width works well. This is also the default size set:

### Adding contents to autoscroll

The autoscroll component has a few demonstration items added to it by default. You can remove these and add your own content:

### Controlling scroll speed 

To control the scrolling speed, change the `Infinite Scroll Speed` property when the autoscroll component is selected. When it's first added, this value is intentionally set low so you can configure the component first. Change this to a higher value to see its content scroll:
