To set up a survey to show users when they close a paywall or perform a purchase, click the **Surveys** button from the **sidebar**:

Every survey you've created for your app will be selectable in this section. Superwall's surveys display natively on the platform it's presented on. For example, on iOS, it will present as an action sheet.

### Close Survey

Select a **close survey** to present when a user closes a paywall and _does not_ purchase a product or start a trial:

Ideally, you'd use these to discover why users aren't willing to pay or become a trialist. By default, Superwall's survey template is a good place to start.

### Post Purchase Survey

Select a **post purchase survey** to present after the user starts a trial or performs a purchase:

These are useful to hone in on what's working, or gain insights about the types of users who are paying.

### Creating or editing surveys

You can open the survey editor from the survey section by clicking **Editing Surveys**:
