title: "Dynamic Values"
---

Dynamic Values allow you to create rules and control flow statements to conditionally apply variables. You can use it for things like:

- Changing the text of a component based on which product is selected.
- Hide and show a modal from a button click.

To open the dynamic values editor, **click** on either the gear icon in the **component editor**, or simply **click** on any property in the **component editor**. In the dropdown, choose **Dynamic**:

When the dynamic values editor shows, **click** on **Add Value** to get started.

### Assigning variables without conditions

**First off, to simply assign a variable _without_ a condition, you still use the dynamic values editor.** For example, if you want some text component's color to match something you have in your [theme](paywall-editor-theme) — just select it and don't insert any rule.

Here, we set the text to the theme's primary color:

### Setting dynamic values

The dynamic values editor works like most control flow interfaces. You set a condition, and choose what should happen when it's met. You can chain multiple conditions together, too. Or, simply use an if/else format.

Check out this example:

<Note>
  Notice how you can use [variables](/paywall-editor-variables) within the dynamic values editor,
  too.
</Note>

It's saying:

1. When the product has an introductory offer (i.e. the condition)
2. Then set the text of the component to "Start \{\{ products.selected.trialPeriodText \}\} free trial" (i.e. what to do when a condition is met)
3. Otherwise, set it to "Subscribe for \{\{ products.selected.price \}\} / \{\{ products.selected.period \}\}."

You can also add rules within a group.

### Rules versus group

When you add a condition, you'll have the choice to either add a rule or a group:

<Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-dynamic-values-step-one.png)</Frame>

Think about them like this:

- Use **rule** when you have one condition you're checking.
  - Ex: If the user has a free trial available, do this.
- Use **group** when you need to aggregate several conditions together to check.
  - Ex: If the user has a free trial available _and_ they are in the United States, do this.
- Use **both** of them together to check complex conditions.
  - Ex: If the user has a free trial available _and_ they are in the United States, _and_ they are on a certain version, do this.

In programming terms, it's a bit like this:

```swift
if user.hasPro && (user.isLegacy && user.isEligibleForProPlus) {
    showUpsellToLegacyUsers()
}
```

The first part of that statement would be a **rule** and the second check that's grouped together would be a **group**.

<Note>You can add rules within groups, or more groups within an existing group.</Note>

### Free trial detection

A common use-case of dynamic values is to conditionally show or hide components, or change copy, based on whether or not the user is eligible for a free trial. To do this, set up a dynamic value as follows:

<Frame>![](/images/freeTrialDetection.png)</Frame>

In short, use `products.hasIntroductoryOffer` to detect whether or not a free trial is available.

<Note>
  If a user has already claimed a free trial for any of the products within the subscription group,
  this value will be `false`.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="No Conditions">
    This text component's color is to set to the theme's primary color without any condition (ie. it
    should always be this color).
    <br />
    <Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-dynamic-values-no-condition.png)</Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="A Single Rule">
    If the product has an introductory offer, the text component will read "Try for free".
    <br />
    <Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-dynamic-values-step-two.png)</Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using a Group">
    Here, we set the text to be larger than it normally would be if the user an introductory offer
    and they haven't seen a paywall in 3 days.
    <br />
    <Frame>![](/images/pe-editor-dynamic-values-group.png)</Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using Both">
    Here, some text is set if the user's app version is greater than `1.1.0` and they are on an
    iPhone. If those are true, and they have an introductory offer — the text "Power up your iPhone
    like never before" is used.
