title: Creating Projects
description: Projects are how Superwall groups the same app together across platforms.

Projects can contain one or more applications. For example, a project for one "app" could have an iOS, Android and web checkout app in the same project. To create a new project, follow these steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Click your existing project">

Open the menu by selecting your existing project from the top-level side of
the sidebar

<Frame>![select application](/images/click-application.png)</Frame>

<br />
</Step>

<Step title="Click New Project">

_You may need to scroll down if you have many apps_

<Frame>![New Project](/images/new-app.png)</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Start typing">
From there, name your app and choose the platform you're building for. You can always add more platforms later.

</Frame>

<Tip>
Superwall can prefill existing iOS apps live on the App Store. If you haven't launched yet, simply choose "Not released yet" and you'll be good to go.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Finish the form">

Once you're all done, you should be able to see your new project and its app and switch between
them using the project switcher on the top left that we used to get started! 🎉
