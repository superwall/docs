title: "Placements"

Placements are the building blocks of a campaign. There are two types of placements:

1. **Standard placements:** These are placements you can use which Superwall already tracks and manages for you. Things like app installs, session start, failed transactions and more. We go into more detail about them [here](/campaigns-standard-placements).
2. **Placements you create:** These are app-specific placements you create. They usually correlate to some "pro" action in your app, like "chartsOpened" or "workoutStarted" in a weight lifting app.

At their core, you register placements that, in turn, present paywalls. They can be as simple as that, or you can combine them with [audiences](/campaigns-audience) to create specific filtering rules to control paywall presentations, create holdouts and more.

To see how they work with our SDK, check out the [docs](/feature-gating). For a quick example, here's what it looks like on iOS:

```swift
Superwall.shared.register(placement: "caffeineLogged") {
  // Action to take if they are on a paid plan
}
```

**Don't be shy about adding placements.** If you think you _might_ want to use a certain feature in your app with a placement — do it now. You can add the placement, and keep it paused. Then, if you ever want to feature-gate that particular flow, you can enable it. No app update required.

In short, add placements for everything you want to feature gate, and things you may _want_ to in the future.

### The placements interface

Under the placements section, you can:

- **Add** new placements.
- **Pause** running placements.
- **Delete** existing placements.

#### Adding a placement

To add a placement, **click** the "+" button in the top-right side of the placements section:

<Frame>![](/images/campaigns-add-placement-button.webp)</Frame>

A modal will appear, and from there you can add a placement via two different means:

1. **Use an existing Superwall event:** Superwall automatically manages several events that can be used as placements. For example, the `survey_response` event could be used to show an entirely different paywall with a discounted offering if a user responded with a particular answer. See the [list](/campaigns-standard-placements) of the Superwall-managed events to learn more.

2. **Create your own, app-specific placement:** Here, you type in whatever event you want to use as a placement in your own app. In a caffeine tracking app, one of them might be when a user logs caffeine — something like `caffeineLogged`.

Either way, once you've selected one from our existing events or typed in your own, **click** on **Add Event** to associate the placement to your campaign:

<Tip>
  You can also add placements "on the fly" by invoking `register(placement:"myNewPlacement")`. If
  the placement you pass doesn't exist for a campaign, Superwall will automatically add it.

### Basic example of placement usage

Consider a caffeine tracking app. At a basic level, we want a paywall to show when a user tries to log caffeine, and they are not on a "pro" plan:

#### Step One: Make the placement

We'd make a placement called `caffeineLogged` inside a campaign:

<Frame>![](/images/campaigns-add-placement.webp)</Frame>

#### Step Two: Assign a paywall

You can use the same paywall across different campaigns, placements, filters and more. In our case, we have one that we to show. So, since this campaign has a paywall linked to it already — we are good to go:

<Frame>![](/images/campaigns-default-paywall.webp)</Frame>

#### Step Three: Register inside our app

Inside our caffeine tracking app, when the user taps a button to log caffeine, we would register the `caffeineLogged` event. This way, if the user is pro, the closure is called and the interface to log caffeine is shown. If they are not pro, then our paywall will show:

```swift
Button("Log") {
    Superwall.shared.register(placement: "caffeineLogged") {
        presentLogCaffeine.toggle()
    }
}
```

And that's it!

<Tip>
  Remember, you can pause placements at any point. So here, if you wanted to run a campaign where
  logging caffeine was free for a weekend — no update would be required. Just tell your users, and
  pause the placement in your Superwall dashboard. No app update required.
</Tip>

There are also several out-of-the box placements you can use, learn more about standard placements [here](/campaigns-standard-placements).
