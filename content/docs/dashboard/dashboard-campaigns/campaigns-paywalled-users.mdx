title: "Paywalled Users"
---

Paywalled users are users that have been presented a paywall from the selected audience. To see recent matches from your audience filter and its resulting transactions, **click** on the **Users** tab above the campaign details:

<Frame>![](/images/campaigns-exp-users.png)</Frame>

You'll find two main sections:

1. **Recent Matches:** Here, you'll see every user which matched your audience filter.
2. **Transactions:** Next, this displays any resulting transaction which occurred within the audience.

<Tip>
  Note that both Recent Matches and Transactions show the [placement](/campaigns-placements) which
  triggered the match or transaction. This is incredibly useful in helping you gauge which actions
  are resulting in conversions.

### Recent matches

Recent Matches show you each user, their locale, and the placement which matched them to your selected audience (among other data) from the last 24 hours:

You can click on any user to see more details about them, including the history of the actions they took. You can also filter events by Superwall-managed events, your own app events and more:

For more on viewing users, check out this [doc](/overview-users).

### Transactions

The transactions shows all transactions which came from the campaign in the last 24 hours:

You can click on any user here, too, to see more details about them. Again, take note of the placements here — because they were directly linked to a conversion.
