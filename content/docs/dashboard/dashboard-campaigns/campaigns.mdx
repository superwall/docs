View **Campaigns** by clicking them over on the left-hand **sidebar**:

Campaigns consist of three main concepts:

1. [Placements](/feature-gating)
2. [Audiences](/campaigns-audience)
3. [Paywalls](/paywall-editor-overview)

Campaigns are the centerpiece of Superwall. You can use one, or several, campaigns that can run concurrently. To understand campaigns, think of them like this:

- In a campaign, you add **placements** — which are actions you want to result in a paywall, or might someday want to result in a paywall(i.e. `loggedCaffeine`, `addedEntry`, etc).
- Then, as users take actions in your app, those placements are **registered** in the Superwall SDK.
- When a placement is registered, it's then evaluated by Superwall. Superwall looks at your campaign **[filters](/campaigns-audience#configuring-an-audience)**, and may or may not show a matching **paywall**.

With this setup, you can be incredibly simple or make in-depth, complex filters which determine when (and what) paywall is shown. You can set the percentage of new users that see each paywall, or even configure no paywall (a.k.a. a holdout) to be shown for certain placements.

### Toggling campaigns by status

You can toggle between campaigns by their status using the tabs at the top (above the campaigns):

- **All:** The default view. This shows all of your campaigns, regardless of their status.
- **Active:** Campaigns being used in production and serving up paywalls.
- **Inactive:** Campaigns that are not serving paywalls in production, but can be quickly re-enabled.
- **Archived:** Campaigns that have been archived, and not attached to any campaign. These can be restored.

### Viewing campaign top-level metrics

Each campaign will also display its active placements and top-level metrics (if any are available). In this example, the campaign at the top has data, while the one below it doesn't:

Metrics shown include:

- **Opens:** The amount of time any of the campaign's placements resulted in a paywall being presented.
- **Conversions:** The number of conversions produced from any paywall attached to the campaign.
- **Conversion Rate:** The conversion rate of the current campaign.

<Note>
  If the campaign isn't currently serving any paywalls because none have been attached to it, you'll
  see a wanting indicating that in this view. In the image above, that's the case for the campaign
  at the bottom, called "Survey".

### Toggling campaigns by date

To toggle the date range that the metrics previously mentioned should display within, use the date toggle at the top-right side:

### Viewing campaign details

To view more about any campaign, to set up filters, edit placements, paywalls and more — simply **click** on any campaign listed in the table. Then, campaigns details will be presented. More on that in the next [page](/campaigns-structure).
