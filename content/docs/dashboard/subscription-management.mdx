## Overview

- **One source of truth:** Superwall ingests purchase lifecycle events from the App Store, Play Store, and Stripe-powered web checkout flows. The platform reconciles those events into user entitlements that power paywall targeting, analytics, and access gates.
- **Entitlements-first:** Products attach to entitlements that represent access tiers. Learn more about configuring them in [Adding Products → Entitlements](/dashboard/products#entitlements).
- **Real-time syncing:** When an event (purchase, renewal, cancellation, refund) lands, Superwall updates the user profile and campaign eligibility automatically.

## Dashboard

### Users Page

The Users page gives you a per-customer timeline that includes subscription events, paywall impressions, and entitlement snapshots. See [Users](/dashboard/overview-users) for the full walkthrough.

- Confirm active entitlements and their expiration.
- Review recent renewals, cancellations, and billing issues.
- See paywall views, SDK events, and other analytics-style activity for that user.

### Audience Filters & Campaign Targeting

Campaigns can check entitlements directly, letting you show different paywalls or post-purchase experiences to subscribers vs. trials. See [Campaign Audience Filters](/dashboard/dashboard-campaigns/campaigns-audience) for details on the filter capabilities.

## Web checkout

Web checkout purchases follow the same entitlement pipeline as native stores and surface throughout the dashboard:

- **Checkout and campaigns** – Configure Stripe credentials and connect campaigns that present web paywalls with [Configuring Stripe Keys and Settings](/web-checkout/web-checkout-configuring-stripe-keys-and-settings) and [Creating Campaigns to Show Paywalls](/web-checkout/web-checkout-creating-campaigns-to-show-paywalls).
- **Redemption** – After purchase, users receive a redemption email. Validate the flow using [Testing Purchases](/web-checkout/web-checkout-testing-purchases) and share the manage URL pattern (`https://{your-domain}.superwall.app/manage`) for manual redemption.
- **Manage page** – Customers update billing, cancel, or request new redemption links from the manage portal documented in [Managing Memberships](/web-checkout/web-checkout-managing-memberships).
- **Settings** – Brand the manage page and configure support contact info in **Settings → General → For Stripe apps**. See [General Settings](/dashboard/dashboard-settings/overview-settings) for field descriptions.

## Integrations

Superwall emits webhook events for every subscription lifecycle change. Connect these via the Integrations page to power downstream systems:

- **Webhooks** – Review payloads and event types in [Integrations](/integrations). Common uses include syncing CRM subscription status, triggering feature flags, or updating internal billing systems.
- **Slack** – Route high-value events into a revenue channel by enabling the [Slack integration](/integrations/slack).
- **Analytics tools** – Send proceeds and lifecycle events into [Mixpanel](/integrations/mixpanel) or other analytics tooling to correlate subscription momentum with product usage.

## SDK

Superwall's SDK tracks subscription status automatically based on your dashboard setup, so adding new products or entitlements does not require code changes. For platform-specific details, start with [Tracking Subscription State](/docs/sdk/quickstart/tracking-subscription-state).
