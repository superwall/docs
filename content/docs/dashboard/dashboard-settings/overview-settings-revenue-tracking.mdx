In the **Revenue Tracking** section under **Settings**, you can set up revenue tracking three different ways. Revenue tracking is required to show revenue metrics in the Superwall dashboard.

## Status

Your revenue tracking status will be listed at the top, indicating if you've successfully set it up or not:

<Frame>![](/images/overview-settings-rev-tracking-status.webp)</Frame>

<Note>
  Until we receive the first event for your app (including Sandbox events), the configuration will still show as **missing**.
</Note>

## Methods

There are different methods for revenue tracking depending on your platform:

- iOS: [App Store Connect](#ios-app-store-connect)
- Android: [Google Play](#android-google-play)

If you're using RevenueCat for purchase handling: [RevenueCat](#revenuecat)

<Warning>
  Choose only **one** of these methods. 
  As soon as you've completed the steps for any of them, you should see integrated events begin to show up in Superwall's metrics.
</Warning>

### iOS: App Store Connect

#### Option 1 - App Store Connect Server Notifications

Use this method to forward subscriptions events from App Store Connect back to Superwall. To get started, go to **App Store Connect → App Information → App Store Server Notifications → Production & Sandbox URL fields:**

<Frame>![](/images/overview-settings-rev-tracking-setup-server.webp)</Frame>

For the URL, use the value in Superwall that was prefilled by clicking the copy button:

<Frame>![](/images/overview-settings-rev-tracking-url.webp)</Frame>

Then, enter this in App Store Connect modal:

<Frame>![](/images/overview-settings-rev-tracking-v2.webp)</Frame>

**Click** the **Save** button once you've entered in the URL.

#### Option 2 - Event Forwarding

If you handle subscription logic on your own server and are using Apple's subscription events notifications, use this method. It will forward Apple subscription events from your server to Superwall.

To implement this method, simply forward the **unmodified request** to Superwall before any other application logic.

Here's a Node.js example, just be sure to use your own API key in place of `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` in the snippet below:

<Warning>Your private key is **not** the same as your public key. Superwall will prefill your private key in the code snippets on the Revenue Tracking page for both Event Forwarding and App Store Connect setup.</Warning>
```javascript
request.post(
  {
    url: "https://superwall.com/api/integrations/app-store-connect/webhook?pk=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(req.body),
    timeout: 5000,
  },
  (error, response, body) => {
    if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
      console.log("Successfully forwarded to Superwall")
    } else {
      console.error("Failed to send notification to Superwall", error)
    }
  }
)
```

#### In-App Purchase configuration

Setting up the in-app purchase configuration for iOS apps allows Superwall to power features like refund
consumption.{" "}

To complete setup, follow these steps:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Step 1">
    - Navigate to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com). - Click on **Users and

    <Note>
      You can reuse the **same key** for all of the apps falling under the same App Store Connect
      account. Though, you must still have access to the one-time download of its generated P8 key
      file. If you don't have access to this anymore, simply create a new one.
    </Note>
    - **Click** on "**Download In-App Purchase Key**" for the new key. On the resulting
    modal, click **Download**.
    <Warning>
      **IMPORTANT**: You only have one chance to download the key file. Make sure to save it in a
      secure location.

### Android: Google Play

You can now forward subscription events directly from Google Play to Superwall. For implementation details, please refer to our guide on [Revenue Tracking for Google Play](/dashboard/dashboard-settings/overview-settings-revenue-tracking-google-play).

### RevenueCat

Finally, if you're using RevenueCat, you can forward subscription events from RevenueCat to back to Superwall. For implementation details, please refer to their [documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/superwall).

#### Tracking Revenue with RevenueCat for iOS and Android Projects

If you are using RevenueCat and have _both_ an Android and iOS app under the same project, be aware that you should have **two** Superwall apps (one for Android and iOS). Then, you can link them together as one project under [Settings -> Projects](/overview-settings-projects). In your RevenueCat project, you can refer to either the iOS or Android key from Superwall. Superwall will still segment the data by platform.

Here's an example, this app has both an Android and iOS project in Superwall. Both of them use RevenueCat:

<Frame>![](/images/rcLinkStep1.webp)</Frame>

In Superwall, those have been linked together as a project:

<Frame>![](/images/rcLinkStep2.webp)</Frame>

For _either_ the iOS or Android project, go to **Settings -> Revenue Tracking -> RevenueCat** and get the integration token (or make one if you haven't yet):

<Frame>![](/images/rcLinkStep3.webp)</Frame>

Finally, in RevenueCat, use the token in their integration settings for Superwall:
