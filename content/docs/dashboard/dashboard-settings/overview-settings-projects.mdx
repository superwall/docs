In the **Projects** section within **Settings**, you logically group your apps together (regardless of the platform they are on):

Projects are typically the same app on multiple platforms. That is, the same app on iOS and Android. Grouping them together as a project can help with organization and make reporting a bit easier to manage.

### Creating a new project

To create a new project, **click** the **Create Project** button at the top right:

From there, give it a name and **click** the **Save** button:

<Frame>![](/images/overview-settings-create-project.webp)</Frame>

### Adding apps to a project

After you've created a project, you can select an app for the iOS and Android platform by clicking their respective buttons:
