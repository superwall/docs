### Viewing paywalls by date

Choose **Custom** to select any arbitrary date range to filter by.

<Note>
  The date toggle works when you are viewing your paywalls as a
  [**list**](#viewing-paywall-metrics).

### Viewing paywalls by status

To view a paywall by its status, click any of the options above the paywalls:

Here's what each status means:

<Note>
  Each paywall displayed corresponds to the currently selected app, located at the top-left of the
  page.
</Note>

| Property | Description                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Viewing paywalls as a table or list
