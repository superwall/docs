<Frame>![](/images/chartsv2_filter.jpeg)</Frame>

<Frame>![](/images/chartsv2_filterOpen.jpeg)</Frame>

When you're done, **click** on the **Apply** button, and the chart will refresh with the data filtered by your selections:

<Frame>![](/images/chartsv2_filterResult.jpeg)</Frame>

To remove an individual filter, **click** on the **trash can** icon on the trailing side of it: 

<Frame>![](/images/chartsv2_remove.jpeg)</Frame>

To remove an individual component that's part of a filter (i.e. breaking down by "Application" and removing one of the included apps), **click** on the **X** button on its trailing side:

<Frame>![](/images/chartsv2_removeSingle.jpeg)</Frame>

To remove all filters, **click** on the **Clear Filters** button:

<Frame>![](/images/chartsv2_removeAll.jpeg)</Frame>

### Breaking down chart data 
To break down data in a chart, **click** the **Breakdown** toggle at the top right:

<Frame>![](/images/chartsv2_breakdown.jpeg)</Frame>

The breakdowns available are tailored to the type of chart you have selected. After you apply a selection, the chart will automatically update. At the bottom of the chart, the data displayed will also be updated according to your breakdown selection:

<Frame>![](/images/chartsv2_breakdownResult.jpeg)</Frame>

<Tip>Breaking down a **Proceeds** chart by **Placements** is a powerful way to directly correlate features you make (or similar things you've paywalled) to your app's revenue growth.</Tip>

### Selecting time ranges
To customize the time span and level of detail of the data displayed on the chart, use the two date toggles at the top right: 

<Frame>![](/images/chartsv2_dates.jpeg)</Frame>

These controls adjust the chart's view interval and data range:

**Display Interval (First Dropdown):** Sets the interval at which data is displayed on the chart. Choose options like Hourly, Daily, Weekly, etc., to adjust how granular the data appears. Selecting "Auto" automatically optimizes the interval based on the selected date range.

**Data Fetch Range (Second Dropdown):** Defines the total date range from which data is fetched and displayed on the chart. Options include Yesterday, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, and more. The selected range determines the period of data used to populate the chart, regardless of the display interval setting.

<Tip>You can also use natural language to set a data fetch range. For example, "last month", "two weeks ago", etc.</Tip>

### Changing chart formats
Each chart type can display its data in different chart formats. To change the default display, **click** on the **Chart** button found at the top right:

<Frame>![](/images/chartsv2_typeToggle.jpeg)</Frame>

You can toggle the chart format between **Stacked Area**, **Line**, **Stacked Bar**, or **Bar**. Here is the same chart data in each format:

<Tabs>
