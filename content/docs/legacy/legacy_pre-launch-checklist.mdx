<Steps>
  <Step title="Have a card on file." stepNumber="1" titleSize="h2">
    In your Superwall account, make sure you've got a card on file to avoid any service disruptions.
    Go to `Settings->Billing` in your Superwall account to add one if you haven't yet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Products are correctly configured." stepNumber="2" titleSize="h2">
    Set up your products in their respective storefront first, whether that's App Store Connect or
    Google Play. Once you've done that, add them into Superwall. All of their respective identifiers
    should match what they are in each storefront. For more details, refer to this
    [page](/products).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Products are on a paywall" stepNumber="3" titleSize="h2">
    Each paywall should display one or more of those previously added products. You can associate
    them easily on the left hand side of the paywall editor.

  </Step>
  <Step title="SDK is configured." stepNumber="4" titleSize="h2">
    Be sure your paywall presents and our SDK is configured in your app. If you need to double check
    things, check out the [docs for the relevant platform](/legacy/legacy_configuring-the-sdk).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete a purchase." stepNumber="5" titleSize="h2">
    Next, after your paywall shows in Testflight and beta builds, make sure you can successfully
    purchase a product, start a trial or kick off a subscription. If you run into an issue, try
    these steps in our [troubleshooting guide](/legacy/legacy_troubleshooting). They solve a majority of the
    common problems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="All subscriptions are approved." stepNumber="6" titleSize="h2">
    Finally, make sure that your subscriptions have been approved in each storefront. On App Store
    Connect, for example, you'll have to send off each one individually for review. If this is your
    initial launch, you can have them approved alongside the first build of your app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If everything looks good here, you should be ready to launch with Superwall.

### Bonus Steps

These aren't essential, but they are good to think about to make sure you're leveraging all Superwall has to offer.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a survey" stepNumber="1" titleSize="h2">
    No matter how much you optimize flows, designs or copy — the truth is that, statistically speaking, the majority of users will not convert. Finding out why is key, and you can do that with our surveys that you can attach to any paywall.

    Once a user closes a paywall, we'll present the survey attached to it. See how to set them up [here](/surveys).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Don't be shy about placements" stepNumber="2" titleSize="h2">
    If you're new to Superwall, it might be tempting to use one, do-it-all placement — like `showPaywall` or something similar. We don't recommend this, please use an individual placement for each action or scenario that could possibly trigger a paywall. The more placements you have, the more flexible you can be. It opens up things like:

    1. Showing a particular paywall based on a placement. For example, in a caffeine tracking app, two of them might be `caffeineLogged` and `viewedCharts`. Later, you could tailor the paywall based on which placement was fired.
    2. You can dynamically make some placements "Pro" or temporarily free to test feature gating without submitting app updates.
    3. In your campaign view, you can see which placements resulted in conversions. This helps you see what particular features users might value the most.

    The easy advice is to simply create a placement for each action that might be paywalled. For a quick video on how to use placements, check out this [YouTube Short](https://youtube.com/shorts/lZx8fAL8Nvw?feature=shared).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use custom audiences" stepNumber="3" titleSize="h2">
  Audiences are how Superwall can segment users by filtering by several different values such as the time of day, app version and more. This lets you target different paywalls to certain audiences. To see an example of how you might set up an advanced example, see this video:
