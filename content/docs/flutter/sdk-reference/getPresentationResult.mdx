title: "getPresentationResult()"
description: "Gets the result of a paywall presentation without actually showing the paywall."
---

## Purpose
Retrieves the presentation result for a placement without presenting the paywall. This is useful for checking whether a paywall would be shown, determining if the user is in a holdout group, or getting experiment information without triggering a paywall presentation.

## Signature
```dart
Future<PresentationResult> getPresentationResult(
  String placement, {
  Map<String, Object>? params,
})
```

## Parameters
<ParamTable>
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `placement` | `String` | The name of the placement to check. |
| `params` | `Map<String, Object>?` | Optional parameters to pass with the placement. These can be referenced within campaign rules. Keys beginning with `$` are reserved for Superwall and will be dropped. Nested maps and lists are currently unsupported and will be ignored. Defaults to `null`. |
</ParamTable>

## Returns / State
Returns a `Future<PresentationResult>` that resolves to one of the following:
- `PlacementNotFoundPresentationResult` - The placement was not found
- `NoAudienceMatchPresentationResult` - No audience match for the placement
- `PaywallPresentationResult` - A paywall would be presented (contains experiment information)
- `HoldoutPresentationResult` - User is in a holdout group (contains experiment information)
- `PaywallNotAvailablePresentationResult` - Paywall is not available

## Usage

Checking if a paywall would be shown:
```dart
final result = await Superwall.shared.getPresentationResult(
  'premium_feature',
  params: {'source': 'onboarding'},
);

if (result is PaywallPresentationResult) {
  print('Paywall would be shown');
  print('Experiment ID: ${result.experiment.id}');
  print('Group ID: ${result.experiment.groupId}');
} else if (result is HoldoutPresentationResult) {
  print('User is in holdout group');
  print('Experiment ID: ${result.experiment.id}');
} else if (result is NoAudienceMatchPresentationResult) {
  print('No audience match');
} else if (result is PlacementNotFoundPresentationResult) {
  print('Placement not found');
} else if (result is PaywallNotAvailablePresentationResult) {
  print('Paywall not available');
}
```

Using with switch expressions:
```dart
final result = await Superwall.shared.getPresentationResult('premium_feature');

switch (result) {
  case PaywallPresentationResult(experiment: final exp):
    print('Paywall would show for experiment ${exp.id}');
  case HoldoutPresentationResult(experiment: final exp):
    print('User in holdout for experiment ${exp.id}');
  case NoAudienceMatchPresentationResult():
    print('No audience match');
  case PlacementNotFoundPresentationResult():
    print('Placement not found');
  case PaywallNotAvailablePresentationResult():
    print('Paywall not available');
}
```
