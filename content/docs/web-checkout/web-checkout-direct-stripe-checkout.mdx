For customers in the United States, you can offer Stripe products directly from your iOS paywalls. This is a great way to streamline the checkout process and make it easier for users to purchase your products.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Configure Web Checkout">
    First, follow the [web checkout setup guide](/web-checkout-overview#getting-setup) to create a Stripe app and configure your web checkout settings. Specifically, you'll need to complete the first three steps. This includes setting up your Stripe keys and configuring your app's settings.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add a Stripe product to an iOS paywall">
    Select a paywall and add a Stripe product to it. This will allow users to purchase the product directly from the paywall. Stripe products are prepended with "stripe" in the product selector:

    </Step>
    <Step title="Choose Web Checkout Location">
    You can control whether or not Stripe checkout opens in your app via Safari, or externally in the Safari app:

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a campaign for U.S. customers">
    Since the ruling only applies to customers in the United States, you can easily create a campaign filter that will match to those customers. Just create a filter where `storeFrontCountryCode` matches `USA`, like this:

    </Step>
    <Step title="Respond to Checkout">
    From there, the flow works the same way as it would for web checkout. Once the payment succeeds, the [Superwall delegate](/using-the-superwall-delegate) functions `willRedeemLink()` and `didRedeemLink(result:)` will be called. You can use these functions to handle the deep link in your app if you need to show any specific UI as described in our [Post-Checkout Redirecting](/web-checkout-post-checkout-redirecting) docs.

    Additionally, the subscription status will be updated automatically and the delegate callback `func subscriptionStatusDidChange(from oldValue: SubscriptionStatus, to newValue: SubscriptionStatus)` will be called. If you're using a `PurchaseController`, refer to [the docs here](/web-checkout-linking-membership-to-iOS-app#using-a-purchasecontroller).
    </Step>
</Steps>

If you need to test checkout, learn how [here](/web-checkout-testing-purchases).

### Prefill email

When starting checkout from an iOS paywall (App2Web), Stripe will automatically prefill the email field if you set the user's `email` as a [User Attribute](/sdk/quickstart/setting-user-properties) in your app before initiating checkout.
