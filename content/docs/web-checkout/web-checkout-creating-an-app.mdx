### Adding a Stripe app to Superwall
Web checkout is represented in Superwall as a Stripe app. To create one, open any existing project and click on the Stripe logo at the top left:

<Note>Right now, web checkout is only available for iOS apps. Android support is coming soon.</Note>

You'll be presented with three fields to fill out:

1. **Platform:** This will default to Stripe — leave this unchanged.
2. **App Name:** Shown at checkout, we recommend using the same name as your app.
3. **Domain:** The URL your paywall will be shown from, and `superwall.app` will be appended to it. You cannot edit this once your app is created.

Once you've filled these out, **click** on **Add App ->**. You'll automatically be taken to your app's [overview](/overview-metrics) page. Next, it's time to [configure your app with Stripe](/web-checkout-configuring-stripe-keys-and-settings).
