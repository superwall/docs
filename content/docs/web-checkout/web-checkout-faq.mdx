### How does restoring memberships work on iOS when you've purchased via web checkout?

When the user taps on the restore link in the paywall, we'll do the normal restore flow for on-device subscriptions. However, if you've enabled web checkout and the restored
entitlements don't match the entitlements belonging to the products on the paywall, we'll present an alert asking the user if they'd like to check for subscriptions on the web. This will
take them out of your app to the [plan management screen](/web-checkout-managing-memberships) where they can get a redemption link to restore their subscriptions.

### What happens if a user taps the redemption link multiple times or shares it?

Redemption codes are single-use and tied to a specific device. Once a code has been redeemed, it cannot be used again on a different device.

However, users can visit the manage page and request a new redemption link. This generates a new code that can be used to activate access on another device.

#### Without accounts (`identify` not called)

If you're not using accounts with Superwall (i.e. you never call `identify`), we allow up to **five active devices** per user. When a sixth device redeems a code, the **first device** to have redeemed a code will automatically lose access. This helps prevent abuse while still supporting reasonable multi-device usage.

#### With accounts (`identify` called)

If you are using accounts with Superwall (i.e. you call `identify` with an `appUserId` when someone logs in), then entitlements are tied to the user ID, not the individual device.

- If two different `appUserIds` redeem codes, **only the most recently identified user will retain access**.
- If the **same `appUserId` is used across multiple devices**, all those devices will **automatically share access** without needing to redeem again.

This system ensures flexibility while protecting against unauthorized sharing of redemption codes.

### How do I associate a web checkout purchase with a user in my app?

The short answer — use Superwall's [user identification APIs](/identity-management#identified-users). When you configure Superwall, or a user signs in or out, you can always associate their login status to Superwall's SDK:

```swift
Superwall.shared.identify(userId: user.id)
```

This will ensure that the user is associated with the web checkout purchase.

### A user paid on the web and can't access their subscription in the app. What should I do?

Direct them to your app's plan management page so they can retrieve their redemption link or manage billing. For example: `http://yourapp.superwall.app/manage`

### When should I use Redirect mode instead of Redeem mode?

Use **Redirect mode** when you need to:
- Show a custom success or onboarding page after purchase
- Perform additional verification or collect more information before granting access
- Integrate with your own deep linking or authentication infrastructure
- Track conversions in your own analytics before redemption

Use **Redeem mode** (the default) when:
- You want Superwall to handle the entire redemption flow automatically
- You don't need custom post-purchase logic
- You want the simplest integration

Most apps should use Redeem mode. You can always switch between modes in your [Application Settings](/web-checkout-configuring-stripe-keys-and-settings#post-purchase-behavior).

### What data is passed to my redirect URL in Redirect mode?

When using Redirect mode, the following query parameters are automatically appended to your custom URL:

**Standard parameters**:
- `app_user_id` - The user's identifier from your app (if you called `identify`)
- `email` - The user's email address from checkout
- `stripe_subscription_id` - The Stripe subscription ID

**Custom parameters**: Any placement parameters you set when creating the web checkout link will also be included.

**Example redirect**:
```
https://yourapp.com/success?
  app_user_id=user_123&
  email=user@example.com&
  stripe_subscription_id=sub_1234567890&
  campaign_id=summer_sale
```

You can use this data to verify the purchase, link it to your user account, or perform custom onboarding. Learn more about [post-checkout redirecting](/sdk/guides/web-checkout/post-checkout-redirecting).
