### Purchase flow overview
When a user clicks on a button to purchase a product, the process will switch over to Stripe's checkout flow:

Once the purchase goes through successfully, they'll be taken to a page where Superwall prompts them to:

1. Download the app.
2. Click the redemption link.

<Note>
Users should click the redemption link _on the device where the app is installed_. If the setting for "Redeemable on Desktop" is diabled, they'll be prompted to continue on an iOS device.
</Note>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

From there, the [redemption flow](/web-checkout-linking-membership-to-iOS-app) occurs.

### Testing a purchase

To test a purchase:

1. Add a [sandbox product](/web-checkout-adding-a-stripe-product#creating-sandbox-products-to-test-with) to a paywall.
2. Visit the paywall URL and checkout.
3. Choose "Card" for the payment method.
3. For the card number, use `4242 4242 4242 4242` with any expiration date later than today, any CVC and fill out the name and zip code.

This will allow you to checkout and go through the entire flow to debug issues, test it out on a device and more.
