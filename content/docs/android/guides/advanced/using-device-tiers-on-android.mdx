title: "Device Tier Targeting"
description: "Target users based on their device performance capabilities to optimize paywall experiences across different hardware tiers."
---

The `deviceTier` variable allows you to create targeted audiences based on device performance capabilities. This helps optimize paywall experiences by showing resource-appropriate content to different device types. You can reference this in campaign filters, dynamic values, or in paywall text via the `device.deviceTier` variable.

<Note>
Device tier targeting is available starting in Android SDK version `2.2.3`. Make sure you're using this version or later to access this feature.

## How device tier works

Device tier classification is based on several hardware factors:
- CPU performance
- Available RAM
- 4K/2K codec support
- Display quality

This automatic classification helps you deliver paywalls that perform well across the full spectrum of Android devices.

### Matching device ranges

When creating device tier filters, you can use `contains` or `equals` for narrower matching:

- **`contains`** - Broader matching that includes partial matches. For example, `deviceTier contains high` matches both `high` and `ultra_high` devices.
- **`equals`** - Exact matching for precise targeting. For example, `deviceTier equals high` matches only `high` tier devices, not `ultra_high`.

Use `contains` when you want to target a range of similar device capabilities, and `equals` when you need precise control over which specific tier to target.

## Device tier values

The `device.deviceTier` attribute returns one of these values:

- **`ultraLow`** - Entry-level devices with limited resources.
- **`low`** - Budget devices with basic performance capabilities.
- **`mid`** - Mid-range devices with moderate performance.
- **`high`** - Premium devices with strong performance.
- **`ultra_high`** - Flagship devices with top-tier specifications.
- **`unknown`** - Device tier couldn't be determined.

## Creating device tier audiences

To target users by device tier, create an audience using the `device.deviceTier` attribute:

1. Navigate to **Campaigns** in your dashboard.
2. Click on the campaign you want to target.
2. Edit, or create, a new audience. 
3. Add a filter where `device.deviceTier` contains your target tier(s).
4. Save your audience.

<Tip>You can target multiple tiers in a single audience. For example, use `deviceTier contains LOW` to target both `ultraLow` and `low` tier devices.</Tip>

### Optimizing for lower-end devices
Create lightweight paywalls for devices that may struggle with resource-intensive content:

```
device.deviceTier contains ultraLow OR device.deviceTier contains low
```

Show these users paywalls with:
- Static images instead of videos.
- Compressed media files.
- Simplified animations.
