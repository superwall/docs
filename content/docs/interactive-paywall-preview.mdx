The top bar allows you to change the localization of the paywall and the device that it's displayed on:

![](/images/5.webp)

As you mouse-over the paywall, you'll see blue boxes appear highlighting the elements of the paywall that are editable. Clicking on one of these will bring up an editor to the right:

![](/images/6.webp)

This is where you define what the end user sees for the selected element. It contains fields that are relevant to the type of element that's selected. For example, text can be edited in a textfield, and images and videos can be replaced.

Above this, you'll see two buttons: **Default** and **Free Trial**:

![](/images/7.webp)

You can click these to toggle between the free trial and default (no free trial) behaviour of the selected element. This also toggles the device preview. When the SDK detects a free trial in any product and the user hasn't already used a free trial within that product's subscription group, it will use the content supplied in the free trial tab. Otherwise it will use the content in the default tab. The free trial tab automatically inherits from the default tab.

### Adding Variables

You can show product, user, or device data within text elements by adding a **Variable**. This uses a language called [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) to substitute in data at runtime.

Click the **\+ Add Variable** button to choose a variable:

![](/images/8.webp)

This opens a navigation menu from which you can select the data you want to display, along with a preview of what that data looks like:

Clicking on a variable row will insert it inside your textfield with double curly brackets, which tells the device to replace it with real data:

The following objects can be referenced and templated within your paywalls:

| Object    | Description                                                                                                       | Example                                                                                                            | User Sees                                                                                  |

You can do complex math on these variables using liquid. [Take a look at their documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid) for more on how to do that.

Additionally, you can use the following device properties: `device.minutesSince_X`, `device.hoursSince_X`, `device.daysSince_X`, `device.monthsSince_X`, and `device.yearsSince_X`, where X is the name of an event that you've [registered](/feature-gating) or a [Superwall event](/tracking-analytics). This gives you the days etc since the last occurrence of the event that you specify, excluding the event that triggered the paywall. For example, a paywall presented via an `app_open` event and the text It has been `{{ device.daysSince_app_open}}` since you last opened the app will show `{{ It has been 2 days since you last opened the app }}`.

### AI Powered Suggestions

When you edit a textfield, the AI Powered Suggestions section will offer alternative suggestions for your text using OpenAI's gpt3:

### Click Behavior

You can set the click behavior of an element by using the **Click Behavior** dropdown:

![](/images/db7c993-Screenshot_2022-11-29_at_16.40.53.webp)

You choose from the following types of click behavior:

| Click Behavior      | Functionality                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
