If you're developing an app using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en), you can use our custom [Cursor User Rule](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) to speed up your development. You can also prepend some of the examples found on [cursorrules.io](https://cursorrules.io), or use your current rule, in addition by adding in our following Superwall User Rule after it. 

Right now, this is available for iOS and Swift with more SDKs and languages to come.

### Cursor user rules setup

To get started:

1. Download the User Rule file for iOS [here](https://github.com/superwall/cursor-rules/blob/main/ios-swiftui-cursor-rules-superwall-sdk.md).
2. In Cursor, go to **Cursor -> Settings... -> Cursor Settings**.

3. Under **User Rules**, paste in the text from the User Rule file.

This feature works much better if you remind Cursor that a code sample is related to Superwall. For example:

```md
// ✅ Try to do it this way!
Using the Superwall SDK, register a placement called "drinkCoffee" and include a print statement saying `Coffee time` in the block.

// ❌ Try not do it this way!
Register a placement called "drinkCoffee" and include a print statement saying `Coffee time` in the block.
```

Remember to check for updates to the User Cursor Rule, as we will edit it when our SDKs change. 

<Note>
Remember, LLMs can be hit or miss with advice — always review the code it suggests! Despite tuning the rules and prompts as best as we can, sometimes you may get inaccurate results.
