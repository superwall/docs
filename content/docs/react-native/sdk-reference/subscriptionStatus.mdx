<Warning>

**Deprecated SDK**

We strongly recommend migrating to the new [Superwall Expo SDK](/expo), see our [migration guide](/expo/guides/migrating-react-native) for details.

</Warning>

## Purpose
Methods for managing the user's subscription status. When using a `PurchaseController`, you must call `setSubscriptionStatus()` to update the user's subscription status whenever entitlements change.

## Methods

### getSubscriptionStatus()

Retrieves the current subscription status of the user.

**Signature:**
```typescript
async getSubscriptionStatus(): Promise<SubscriptionStatus>
```

**Returns:** A Promise that resolves to the current `SubscriptionStatus`.

**Usage:**
```typescript
const status = await Superwall.shared.getSubscriptionStatus()
console.log("Subscription status:", status)
```

### setSubscriptionStatus()

Sets the subscription status of the user. When using a `PurchaseController`, you must call this method to update the user's subscription status. Alternatively, you can implement the [`SuperwallDelegate.subscriptionStatusDidChange`](/react-native/sdk-reference/SuperwallDelegate) delegate callback to receive notifications whenever the subscription status changes.

**Signature:**
```typescript
async setSubscriptionStatus(status: SubscriptionStatus): Promise<void>
```

**Parameters:**
<ParamTable>
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `status` | `SubscriptionStatus` | The new subscription status. |
</ParamTable>

**Returns:** A Promise that resolves once the subscription status has been updated.

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { SubscriptionStatus } from "@superwall/react-native-superwall"

// Set active subscription with entitlements
const activeStatus = SubscriptionStatus.Active(["pro"])
await Superwall.shared.setSubscriptionStatus(activeStatus)

// Set inactive subscription
const inactiveStatus = SubscriptionStatus.Inactive()
await Superwall.shared.setSubscriptionStatus(inactiveStatus)
```

## SubscriptionStatus Type

The `SubscriptionStatus` type represents the user's subscription state:

- `SubscriptionStatus.Active(entitlements: string[] \| Entitlement[])` - User has an active subscription with the specified entitlements
- `SubscriptionStatus.Inactive()` - User does not have an active subscription
- `SubscriptionStatus.Unknown()` - Subscription status is unknown

## When to Update

- After a successful purchase
- After a purchase restoration
- When a subscription expires
- When a subscription is cancelled
- On app launch (to sync with your backend)
